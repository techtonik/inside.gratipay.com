# This is Heroku file used by Multi buildpack to choose building
# enviroment. The buildpack is patched to support comments. See

# for more info.
#
# To setup Heroku, create new application without specifying its
# type (don't choose Python). Then add BUILDPACK_URL variable:
# 
# BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/techtonik/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
# 
# This URL will change when/if
# https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi/pull/8 is merged.

# We use patched Python buildpack that installs vendorized
# dependencies from project's /vendor directory.
https://github.com/techtonik/heroku-buildpack-python.git
# This may ot may not be fixed in official buildpack.
